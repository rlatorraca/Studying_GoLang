            <option name="content" value="The `comparable` interface in GoLang is used to define how different types can be compared to each other. It declares a single method `func CompareTo(other T) int`, which takes another value of the same type and returns an integer indicating the relationship between the two values. The returned integer should be negative if the receiver is less than the other, zero if they are equal, and positive if the receiver is greater than the other. &#10;&#10;The `comparable` interface is used by sorting algorithms and data structures like trees that need to compare values to determine their position in the data structure. Only types that can be ordered, such as numbers and strings, can be made `comparable`. Slices and structs can also be made comparable if all their elements/fields are themselves comparable." />
